### EleNa - Elevation Based Navigation System
Current routing systemsâ€™ shortest path is not necessarily the shortest path with elevation gain considered.

The goal of this project is to design a navigation system that takes the elevation gain in a route into account.

We consider two features of elevation gain - maximum elevation gain and minimum elevation gain.

We introduce a design constraint that limits the resultant route to x% of the shortest path. For instance, a route from source to destination that takes 1 mile in the shortest path can be constrained to a 1.5 mile path with minimum elevation gain. A trade off might occur between the shortest path with desirable elevation v/s the actual shortest path.

#### Execution
1. Run 'python3 -m pip install requirements.txt'
2. Run './run.sh' for running the server

#### Running unit tests
1. There are 2 test files under the test directory, one for algorithms and one for flask app
2. Run "python3 -m pytest" to run all the test cases
3. Please find attached the test session summary in the Project Report
